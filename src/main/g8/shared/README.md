# Shared (JVM/JS)

The sources defined in this module are cross-compiled to Java Bytecode and JavaScript. The `backend` and `frontend`
modules depend on this one, so everything you define here can be used both in the server and the client code.

You can find four main packages in the sources of this module:
* `$package$.shared.css` - definition of application stylesheets.
* `$package$.shared.i18n` - definition of translations used in the application.
* `$package$.shared.model` - model classes which are useful in the RPC communication.
* `$package$.shared.rpc` - RPC interfaces for bidirectional client-server communication.

## CSS

The definition of CSS styles in Udash is based on the [ScalaCSS](https://github.com/japgolly/scalacss) library.
It provides type-safe stylesheets definition with automatic class names generation. Unfortunately ScalaCSS 
generates a lot of JavaScript code and significantly reduces application start-up performance. 
Udash provides tools for server-side CSS rendering with type-safe class references. 
It allows to keep benefits of ScalaCSS DSL and decrease JS size and initialization time. 

You can find more details regarding stylesheets definitions in 
[Udash Guide](http://guide.udash.io/#/frontend/templates) and [ScalaCSS docs](https://github.com/japgolly/scalacss).

## I18n

Udash provides tools for a type-safe translations management. Besides simple translation key declaration, you can 
define the count and the types of arguments passed to the translation. 

```scala
// notice that this translation takes one Int argument
val connections = key1[Int]("chat.connections")
val inputPlaceholder = key("chat.input.placeholder")
```

You can find more details regarding translations in [Udash Guide](http://guide.udash.io/#/ext/i18n).

## Model

With Scala.js you can share your data model classes between the client and the server application. In this case 
we cross-compile classes describing user's context and permissions, chat message and exceptions used for RPC 
call failures.

The `SharedExceptions` class extends `ExceptionCodecRegistry` provides `GenCodec`s for shared exceptions, so
they can be serialized and passed to the client as a result of an RPC call. 

The Udash Guide describes the [auth utilities](http://guide.udash.io/#/ext/authorization) provided via `UserContext` and 
the [exception handling in RPC](http://guide.udash.io/#/rpc/client-server).

## RPC

Interfaces are the most important part of the Udash RPC system. Thanks to cross compilation, 
they make client-server communication easy to develop and maintain. 

You can find two types of RPC interfaces in Udash:
* Server RPC - the RPC interface exposed by the server-side - `MainServerRPC`.
* Client RPC - the RPC interface exposed by the client-side - `MainClientRPC`.

Methods exposed by the RPC interface can be divided into three groups:
* **Calls** - methods returning `Future[T]` where `T` is a serializable type (a client RPC interface cannot expose these methods).
* **Fires** - methods with a `Unit` return type, which are not guaranteed or acknowledged on delivery.
* **Getters** - methods returning another RPC interface. Calling these does not send anything over the network.

Both call and fire methods are asynchronous. Calls will complete the returned Future as soon as an response is received. 
**Fire** is a *fire&forget* method, there is no acknowledgement that the request reached its recipient.

The RPC system uses some macro-generated code. To keep the JavaScript code as small as possible and make compilation faster, 
create a companion object extending the `RPCCompanion` class from the RPC framework for each RPC interface you write. 
The RPC framework describes supported RPC and serialization methods. 
In this case we use `DefaultClientUdashRPCFramework` for the client interfaces and 
`DefaultServerUdashRPCFramework` for the server API. 

Read more about RPC interfaces in the [Udash Guide](http://guide.udash.io/#/rpc/interfaces).

## What's next?

You are now familiar with the shared parts of the code. It's time to take a look at the `backend` module.
