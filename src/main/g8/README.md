# My Udash App

Thank you for choosing Udash! Your Udash Starter Pack is ready to compile and run. 
It contains simple chat application, which presents example usage of the most important 
Udash features, e.g. properties and bidirectional RPC, 
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) Components, i18n, etc.

## Compile and run

The project is using [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) for configuration. We assume that 
you have SBT installed on your system, so when you type `sbt sbtVersion` in your console, 
you should see something like:

```sbtshell
[info] $sbt_version$
```

From our experience the most convenient way to develop Udash applications is to keep compilation of the backend 
and the frontend modules separate. 
This configuration follows this rule, but feel free to change it as you like. 
The compilation of the whole project can be triggered with the following command: 
`sbt compile compileStatics run`. 

* `compile` - compiles all sources with standard Scala compiler.
* `compileStatics` - compiles all static resources of the frontend module, it depends on:
  * `copyAssets` - copies all assets from `frontend/src/main/assets` to the target directory,
  * `compileCss` - starts `CssRenderer` from the backend module and creates CSS files in the target directory,
  * `fastOptJS` - compiles Scala sources to the JavaScript file.
* `compileAndOptimizeStatics` - it's similar to `compileStatics`, but it depends on `fullOptJS`, so it creates minimized JS files.
* `run` - starts main class of the backend module - it runs Jetty server and you can open your application on [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080).

The JVM launcher closes the server on user input, so you can tap Enter to stop it anytime.

When you work on your frontend application, you can keep the server running in an SBT session. 
At the same time you can run `sbt ~compileStatics` in another console and get a fresh frontend
build on every source change. It will also render the CSS files every time.

## The Starter Pack content 

When you open the app homepage in your browser, you should see a login page form. In the top-right corner 
you can change the page language. Below you can type user credentials (e.g. `test` and `test`; 
as described in the tooltip next to the "Username" field - credentials are defined in the `application.conf` file)
and go to the chat window. 

On the chat view you can type, send and read messages. You should try to open another browser window and 
check that messages and connection counts refresh automatically. Server notifies authenticated clients
about these events via [Server -> Client RPC](http://guide.udash.io/#/rpc/server-client) notification. 
You receive a random set of permissions on every login, so sometimes you might not be able to 
send or read messages.   

The application consists of three modules: `shared`, `frontend` and `backend`. In every module you 
can find another a README.md file describing its content. 

Briefly:
* `shared` - contains a global model and a login of the application, it also keeps CSS styles definition and RPC interfaces;
* `backend` - holds the server-side logic, it uses [Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) as the servlets container;
* `frontend` - keeps views and the client's application logic. 

Each module contains tests based on [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/) and [ScalaMock](http://scalamock.org/).
The `frontend` and `shared` modules use [scalajs-env-selenium](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js-env-selenium) in order
to run the tests compiled to JavaScript in a web browser. Take a look at `browserCapabilities` in `build.sbt` - 
it configures the tests to run on Google Chrome in headless mode. 
Just make sure you have [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) installed.  

This configuration employs the [SBT Native Packager](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager) 
in the `packager` module to provide easy deployment process. In this module you can find a customized 
application's configuration. With `sbt packager/universal:packageBin` you can create a zip archive with 
your application and nice starting scripts. Check the 
[SBT Native Packager](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager) docs for more details. 

## What's next?

Take a look around the codebase. You can find more detailed READMEs inside each of the modules. 
The code itself is also documented, so we hope you understand it without an issue.
We recommend to start from the `shared` module. 

You should also take a look at the [Udash Developers Guide](http://guide.udash.io/).
